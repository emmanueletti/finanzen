## About

A privacy-focused, free and open-source financial management tool to help
Canadian households understand their money better.

## Development

Make sure the foreman gem is globally installed

```bash
gem install foreman
```

To start the server with tailwind running as well

```bash
bin/dev
```

This uses foreman to start both the Tailwind watch process and the rails server in development mode.
